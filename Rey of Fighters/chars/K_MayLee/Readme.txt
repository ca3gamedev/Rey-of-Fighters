Q&A

Q. You sure are slow at making characters
A. Yeah I know. Sorry. My Hard disk kept crashing and I had to remake the sff like 4 times

Q. What game did you base her off?
A. She's based off her 2K2 appearance (not UM(for now), I don't have that game, :P)
with two extra moves she had in 2K1. Soon I will add an EX mode that will make
her play like she does in 2K1.
