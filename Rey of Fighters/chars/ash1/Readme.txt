Disclaimer:
-----------
 + No modifications.
 + No redistribution.
 + No announcements of his release anywhere.  I am perfectly capable of doing my own 
   announcements.  Granted, in a few cases where I am specifically asked in a civil fashion 
   if one of my creations can be announced on a particular forum I've been known to give 
   the "okay".  It's not going to happen on NWMF or MGBR, I can tell you that much.
 + No theft, in any shape or form; regardless of the rules your forum enforces.
 + No exceptions.

 Break any of the rules and he gets deleted and/or discontinued. It's as simple as that.


===--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------===
What's Done:
------------
 + Portraits: Default big portrait with an edited small one; the KOF2003 ones kinda sucked.
 + All Hitsparks (relative to this character).
 + Super init sparks.
 + Get Hits: All of the MUGEN required sprites with the KOF extras.
 + Movement: Walking, jumping, running, etc.
 + Evades and guard cancels.
 + Normal attacks: Standing, crouching and jumping A to D.
 + Command attacks: Messidor, Floreal and Prairial.
 + Throws... Well, there was only one to start with anyway.
 + All special moves.
 + All desperation moves.
 + Custom super desperation moves.
 + Leader desperation move.
 + Neo Wave special move cancel system.


===--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------===
What's Left:
------------
 + Some KOF CLSN.
