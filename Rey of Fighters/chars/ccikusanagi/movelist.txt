CC Iron KUSANAGI
By David Demianoff aka Ironmugen

MOVELIST:
========


Basic movements:
---------------

X = Weak punch
Y = strong punch
A = weak kick
B = strong kick

A+X (C) = Roll forward (hold back to roll back)
B+Y (Z) = Knock down attack
A+X+Y = Build up the power gauge.

Start = Taunt

(Close) Forward/Back + Y = Hatsugane
(Close) Forward/Back + B = Issetsu Seoi Nage

Special attacks:
---------------

Forward + A = Geshiki: Goufu You

2nd hit is overhead if not canceled into.
If this move has been canceled into, it becomes faster and cancelable.


Down Forward + B = 88 Shiki

Hits low.


(in air) Down + Y = Geshiki: Naraku Otoshi

Overhead attack.


Forward + X = 115 Shiki: Dokugami

Can be canceled.
If it has been canceled from Geshiki: Goufu You, the move will be faster.
The timings of the fast version are taken from KOF96.


Deadly attacks:
--------------

QCF + X/Y = 108 Shiki: Yamibarai

A ground fireball.


DPF + X/Y = 108 Shiki: Oniyaki

As an autoguard before the 1st hit
X version hits twice on a counter.


DPB + A/B = 101 Shiki: Oboroguruma

X version does a single air kick, Y version does a triple kick (last hit knocks down the ennemy hardly)


QCF + A/B, A/B = 75 Shiki Kai

The A version (start) cannot be juggled after, while the B version can.


HCB + A/B = 212 Shiki: Kototsuki You

Even if the 1st hit is blocked, Kusanagi will try to throw his opponent.
If the 1st hit connect and the opponent is in air, the throw does not sometime hits the opponent.
The running frame is from SVC: Chaos.


QCB + X/Y = 910 Shiki: Nue Tsumi

The 1st frames of the move has a counter-autoguard - low level (Geshiki: Ryuu Iri)
The frames before the movehit has also a counter-autoguard - mid/high level (Geshiki: Tora Fuse)



Desperation moves:
-----------------

QCB, HCF + X/Y = Ura 108 Shiki: Orochi nagi

You can hold X/Y to delaye.
If delayed with the X button, during the charge Kusanagi will not be hit by any low attacks.
If delayed with the Y button, during the charge Kusanagi will not be hit by any high/medium attacks.
This move has 3 levels, longer you delaye, and more the move will be powerfull.


Forward, HCF + X/Y = 96 Shiki

The last hit knocks up the opponent and allow you to juggle.
This move has been taken from KOF96 's debug sprite viewer.


QCF, QCF + X/Y = 182 Shiki

You can hold X/Y to delaye.
This move has 3 levels, longer you delaye, and more the move will be powerfull.


* All moves here require power bar at 1 or more.


Super Desperation moves:
-----------------------

QCF, HCB + X/Y = Kin 1211 Shiki: Yaotome

Nothing in particular to note. Has no follow-up.
Iori 's classic DM. I have added it since Kusanagi does it in the KOFZ comic.


QCF, QCF, QCF, QCF + X+Y = San Shingi no Ni

Do during the Yaotome explosion.
It's Iori 's sacred sword (against Orochi) in KOF97 ending or in SVC/KOF2003.


* The Yaotome requires power bar at 2 or more.
* The San Shingi no Ni requires the power bar at 1 (Yaotome + this = 3)


Hyper desperation move:
----------------------

QCF, QCF + X+Y = Saishuu Kessen Ougi Reishiki

The flame explosion can negate projectiles.


Forward, HCF + X+Y = Teio Shukumyoken

This hyper projectile can negate normal projectiles.
Chonshyu/Chonrei 's DM projectile. I added it because they have something related... in UG.


* All moves here require power bar at 3.
