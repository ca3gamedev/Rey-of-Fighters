Here there's my own kof ikemen go fan game.
It's just a basic ikemen go plus the tag team assist patch.
The rest is just most of the kof roster.

The goal of the system, is mostly kof 2002 max mode, plus tag combos with assists, similar to Marvel 2.
It's not meant to be the best mugen game ever.
I made this mostly for myself, and hopefully others simply enjoy it.

:D

Thanks to the Ikemen and mugen comunity for making my dream kof game possible.
Many thanks.
